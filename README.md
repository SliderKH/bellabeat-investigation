The correlation between total minutes of sleep and total time in bed seems to be linear. Therefore, to improve their sleep, Bellabeat users can benefit from the use of notifications before bed.

## 5. Conclusion

### Conclusion based on analysis:

A sedentary lifestyle comprises a large portion, 81%, of daily activity for users, with an average of 12 hours spent in sedentary activities, 4 hours in light activities, and only 30 minutes in fairly or very active activities.

Marketing recommendations for global expansion:

A reward system could be implemented whereby users earn Bellabeat points for completing a weekly exercise regimen.

The Leaf health tracker can also encourage activity by vibrating or buzzing after extended periods of inactivity, and remind users to sleep if they've been out of bed for too long.

For weight loss, monitoring daily calorie intake can be helpful. Bellabeat can offer healthy nutrition options and data-driven recommendations

More data are needed for more precise and broader conclusions.
